  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview 05-20\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash May 20th Checkpoint is Google's state-of-the-art workhorse model, specifically designed for advanced reasoning, coding, mathematics, and scientific tasks. It includes built-in \"thinking\" capabilities, enabling it to provide responses with greater accuracy and nuanced context handling.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 27 emotion labels.\n\nModel: google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: This model includes built-in thinking capabilities for enhanced reasoning and accuracy.",
