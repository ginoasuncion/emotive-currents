  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nGPT-3.5 Turbo is OpenAI's fastest model. It can understand and generate natural language or code, and is optimized for chat and traditional completion tasks. While not as advanced as GPT-4 models, GPT-3.5 Turbo offers a good balance of performance and speed for many applications.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of GPT-3.5 Turbo on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: GPT-3.5 Turbo is expected to provide solid baseline performance on emotion classification, offering good speed while maintaining reasonable accuracy.",
