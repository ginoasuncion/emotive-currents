  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Google Gemma 3 27B\n\nGemma 3 introduces multimodality, supporting vision-language input and text outputs. It handles context windows up to 128k tokens, understands over 140 languages, and offers improved math, reasoning, and chat capabilities, including structured outputs and function calling. Gemma 3 27B is Google's latest open source model, successor to Gemma 2.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Google Gemma 3 27B on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 27 emotion labels.\n\nModel: google/gemma-3-27b-it:free\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 1 sample per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics",
