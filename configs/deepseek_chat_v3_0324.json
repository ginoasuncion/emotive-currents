  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using DeepSeek Chat V3 0324\n\nDeepSeek V3, a 685B-parameter, mixture-of-experts model, is the latest iteration of the flagship chat model family from the DeepSeek team. It succeeds the DeepSeek V3 model and performs really well on a variety of tasks.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of DeepSeek Chat V3 0324 on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 27 emotion labels.\n\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: This is a massive 685B parameter model with mixture-of-experts architecture, expected to deliver exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks like emotion classification.",
