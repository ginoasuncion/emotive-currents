  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4\n\nClaude Sonnet 4 significantly enhances the capabilities of its predecessor, Sonnet 3.7, excelling in both coding and reasoning tasks with improved precision and controllability. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench (72.7%), Sonnet 4 balances capability and computational efficiency, making it suitable for a broad range of applications from routine coding tasks to complex software development projects. Key enhancements include improved autonomous codebase navigation, reduced error rates in agent-driven workflows, and increased reliability in following intricate instructions. Sonnet 4 is optimized for practical everyday use, providing advanced reasoning capabilities while maintaining efficiency and responsiveness in diverse internal and external scenarios.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Claude Sonnet 4 on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: Claude Sonnet 4 is expected to achieve exceptional performance on emotion classification due to its enhanced reasoning capabilities and improved instruction following.",
