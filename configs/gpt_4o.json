  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using OpenAI GPT-4o\n\nGPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\") is OpenAI's latest AI model, supporting both text and image inputs with text outputs. It maintains the intelligence level of GPT-4 Turbo while being twice as fast and 50% more cost-effective. GPT-4o also offers improved performance in processing non-English languages and enhanced visual capabilities.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of GPT-4o on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: openai/gpt-4o\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: GPT-4o is expected to excel at emotion classification due to its improved performance, faster inference, and enhanced language understanding capabilities.",
