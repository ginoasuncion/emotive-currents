  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp\n\nGemini Flash 2.0 offers a significantly faster time to first token (TTFT) compared to Gemini Flash 1.5, while maintaining quality on par with larger models like Gemini Pro 1.5. It introduces notable enhancements in multimodal understanding, coding capabilities, complex instruction following, and function calling. These advancements come together to deliver more seamless and robust agentic experiences.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 27 emotion labels.\n\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics",
