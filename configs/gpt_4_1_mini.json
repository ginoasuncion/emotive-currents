  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini\n\nGPT-4.1 Mini is a mid-sized model delivering performance competitive with GPT-4o at substantially lower latency and cost. It retains a 1 million token context window and scores 45.1% on hard instruction evals, 35.8% on MultiChallenge, and 84.1% on IFEval. Mini also shows strong coding ability (e.g., 31.6% on Aider's polyglot diff benchmark) and vision understanding, making it suitable for interactive applications with tight performance constraints.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of GPT-4.1 Mini on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: openai/gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: GPT-4.1 Mini is expected to perform competitively with GPT-4o while offering better cost efficiency and lower latency, making it ideal for production emotion classification applications.",
