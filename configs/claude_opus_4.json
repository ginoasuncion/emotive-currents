  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Anthropic Claude Opus 4\n\nClaude Opus 4 is benchmarked as the world's best coding model, at time of release, bringing sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows. It sets new benchmarks in software engineering, achieving leading results on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%). Opus 4 supports extended, agentic workflows, handling thousands of task steps continuously for hours without degradation.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Claude Opus 4 on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: anthropic/claude-opus-4\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: Claude Opus 4 is expected to achieve exceptional performance on emotion classification due to its advanced reasoning and structured output capabilities.",
