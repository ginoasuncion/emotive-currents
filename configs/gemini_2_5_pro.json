  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro is Google's state-of-the-art AI model designed for advanced reasoning, coding, mathematics, and scientific tasks. It employs \"thinking\" capabilities, enabling it to reason through responses with enhanced accuracy and nuanced context handling. Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves top-tier performance on multiple benchmarks, including first-place positioning on the LMArena leaderboard, reflecting superior human-preference alignment and complex problem-solving abilities.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 28 categories (27 emotions + neutral).\n\nModel: google/gemini-2.5-pro\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 3 samples per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics\n\nNote: Gemini 2.5 Pro is expected to achieve exceptional performance on emotion classification due to its advanced reasoning capabilities and superior human-preference alignment.",
