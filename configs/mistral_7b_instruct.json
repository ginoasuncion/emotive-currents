  "description": "Emotion Classification Experiment using Mistral 7B Instruct\n\nA high-performing, industry-standard 7.3B parameter model, with optimizations for speed and context length. Mistral 7B Instruct has multiple version variants, and this is intended to be the latest version.\n\nThis experiment evaluates the performance of Mistral 7B Instruct on the GoEmotions dataset for multi-label emotion classification. The model is tested using zero-shot prompting with a comprehensive prompt that includes all 27 emotion labels.\n\nModel: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free\nTemperature: 0.1\nDataset: GoEmotions validation set\nSampling: Stratified sampling with exactly 1 sample per emotion\nReproducibility: Fixed random seed (42) ensures same dataset on each run\nMetrics: Macro/Micro F1, Precision, Recall, Top-2/3 Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Per-emotion performance\nOutput: CSV with detailed results, MLflow tracking for all metrics",
